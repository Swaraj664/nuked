how to use:

you must first have python installed, and added to path (duh).

if the run me first batch file doesnt work/crashes immediately, you probably dont have pip installed.
you can see if you do or do not by opening a command prompt and typing "pip" with no quotation marks. 
if nothing is shown/unknown command error, you do not have python added to path.
add it to path my following the instructions on my github.

if the run me first freezes mid installation, open a command prompt and navigate to the directory with the selfbot in it and type:
pip install -r requirements.txt

it should install correctly, if any errors show, look at the error and try resolving it by searching the error up.

if everything installs correctly, you can run the selfbot by typing in the command line:
python main.py  

or running the RUN ME SECOND batch file.

if there are any module errors, you can fix this by typing this into the command prompt:
pip install modulename 

as long as your token is in the config.json, everything should work fine.

updates will be posted frequently, check my github every week or so to update.
