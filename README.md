# How to use

you can run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' or the 'RUN ME FIRST.bat,' they do the same thing.
put your token and password in config.json
run the 'RUN ME SECOND.bat,' or 'python bot.py'

# What do I need for this?
you will need python version >= 3.5 and you will need it added to path, if you do not know how to do this, relaunch python setup and click add to path. if there is no option for that then uninstall python and reinstall it and click ADD PYTHON x.x TO PATH on the first screen.
