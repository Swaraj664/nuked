Nuked Discord Selfbot

# Message
I'm unsure whether or not I'm going to keep running this project as selfbotting is hitting a low at this point.   
If you were unaware, [discord.py may be getting discontinued](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1), and this leaves no incentive for me to work on this project as there will not be any "new" features added.   
If I do continue, the next update release time will be uncertain.   
With that being said, v5 could be on the way.
